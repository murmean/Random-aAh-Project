# random-aAh-Project
Open Source Project for anyone

Rules:
1. Your commits must be done on a different branch that you create, afterwards i'll check if there are any merging issues if not your modifications to the project will be uploaded to the main branch.
2. Your modifications must not break the project entirely neither modify someone else's work without their permission (sa nu se supere nimenea)
3. You can do whatever you want with the project so have fun with it ðŸ˜Ž
